# JSFun
Some code for Javascripting fun

1. The odd/even sort sorts in O(n) and has O(1) space complexity.

2. A Queueing system in Javascript (for messaging, quite rudimentary). The server stores messages in array and returns them upon request with the option to delete within a certain amount of time.

Will continue to add interesting stuff I do here.
